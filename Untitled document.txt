Since this is jquery implement AJAX with api to get the function of website/app this is what will happen


All 4 squares are just jquery DOM manipulation, most of it will not change, there will be things append and changed but there will not be much refreshing of the page happening here. Ideally what will happen here will be


Square 1 -> Original page with simple functions of the ability to search for a character and the number that you want returned


Square 2 -> Results


Square 3 -> ??????


Square 4 -> ??????


(3 and 4 are not sure yet since this will just be a search database...with input and feedback perhaps I can change that aspect)
