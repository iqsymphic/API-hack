This app is essentially for any final fantasy XIV player who is curious about their character's ranking,
both locally and globally, in comparison to the rest of the server/world. The app is effectively datamining
and using a side lodestone in conjunction with another server to assist in dynamically updating the 
character information every time the user wishes to refresh the information.

Technologies used: Front End (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery
