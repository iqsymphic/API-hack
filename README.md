# FFXIV-CharacterData #

## **Attention:** Final Fantasy XIV Players!

### *Tired of going to an entirely different website, parsing your information, and then waiting for outdated information?*

### *Do you want to know some of the more crucial data about your character/profile at the exact moment?

### Well then, wonder no more!

### This app is essentially for any final fantasy XIV player who is curious about their character's ranking,
### both locally and globally, in comparison to the rest of the server/world. The app is effectively datamining
### and using a side lodestone in conjunction with another server to assist in dynamically updating the 
### character information every time the user wishes to refresh the information.

### Confused by how it works? Don't be! There's a few screen shots that will tell you just what to expect!
